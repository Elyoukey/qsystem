The story of the game<br/>
<br/>
The 2nd of July 1839, a slave ship, named La Amistad, arrived in Havana, Cuba with 53 Africans who came from Sierra Leone. 
Their travel was illegal, so they got declared as Cuban, a way to show that is a Spanish settlement.

<br/>
The boat had an easy passage because the shipowner had trafficked the documents to legalize the transport by using two navies: La Amistad and la Tecora, a slave ship.
<br/>
With Joseph Cinque, the Africans decided to revolt face to their jailers.
<br/>
After that, they asked to return in Africa but they got deceived in their destination by the boat captain.
<br/>
He conducted them in the north in Long Island, New York.
<br/>
They got arrested in Connecticut, a country in the north-east and the ship got taken by the American navy. <br/>
Then, a process has been declared about the navy and the Africans captives.
In 1835, the Supreme Court of the United States declared that the slaves have been taken from Africa by force. In 1842, there are only 35 survivants and they returned in their native country in Sierra Leone.

This is one of the most important stories in America because it is a big part of the slavery abolition.
