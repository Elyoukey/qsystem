Rebecca and Harriet were friends ever since they were born, they both escaped together to Philadelphia in 1849. But they soon returned to the plantations to help their family and friends escape as well. They made a total of 10 escape journeys but on the last, Rebecca was found dead before they could return to the northern states. When Harriet and Rebecca arrived at the plantation they separated to each go find their family. This time, when it was time to leave, the slaves Rebecca was supposed to find arrived without her. They all went searching for her and found her dead behind shack right next to the closer field to the slave shack...
Looking closely they could see a big open gash in her neck that was the wound left behind by the weapon used by the killer.
